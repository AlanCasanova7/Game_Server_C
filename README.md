# Game_Server_C
Prototype of what a simple dedicated server would look like in C. 
It should also have some sort of "Actor"/"Gameobject".
The plan is to Re-Write all of this in C++, classes and inheritance will probably make the code cleaner and easier to mantain. 
Implementing some kind of "Actor"/"Gameobject" it's also going to be a lot easier and safer thanks to classes and inheritance.
