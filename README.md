# Game_Server_C
Prototype of what a simple dedicated server would look like in C. It should also have some sort of "Actor"/"Gameobject" inside however, due to the fact that soon I will rewrite this in C++ I will not do any kind of such implementation because the code will look a lot cleaner, safer and easier to mantain mainly thanks to c++ inheritance.
